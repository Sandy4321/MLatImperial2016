## Machine learning - 2016 

### Initial preparations

First, we need to check that everything we need is working.
  
We won't have special time for this throughout the course and we need to know about possible issues,
so please before 25th Jan complete following steps: 
  
1. register at [github](https://github.com/) 
2. register at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
3. login to [everware](https://everware.rep.school.yandex.net/) with your github account. Put `https://github.com/yandexdataschool/MLatImperial2016` as a git repository url and press launch.
   Everware will start a personal container (with copy of this repository)
4. click on `0 - Initial notebook`. Run it (`Cell > Run All`) from the beginning up to the end. 
   It should generate a basic submission and provide a link to download it.
6. download a submission and upload it to [kaggle challenge](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/sms-spam-classification).


In case of problems write to gitter chat.
