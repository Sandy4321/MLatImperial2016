Course on machine learning organized by [Yandex Data School] (https://yandexdataschool.com/) at Imperial College.

### Initial preparations

First, we need to check that everything we need is working.
  
We won't have special time for this throughout the course and we need to know about possible issues beforehand,
so please before 25th Jan complete following steps (this should take 5 - 10 minutes): 
  
1. register at [github](https://github.com/)
2. register at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
3. login to [everware](https://everware.rep.school.yandex.net/) with your github account. 
   Put `docker:arogozhnikov/mlatimperial2016` in the field for url.
   Everware will start a personal container (with copy of this repository)
4. (at everware) in the folder `MLatImperial2016` click on notebook `0 - Initial notebook`. 
   Run it (`Cell > Run All`) from the beginning up to the end. 
   It should generate a basic submission and provide a link to download it.
6. download a submission and upload it to [kaggle challenge](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/sms-spam-classification).


In case of problems write to [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/yandexdataschool/MLatImperial2016).

To dive faster into data analysis it is suggested to study the essentials of python and its scientific libraries using  [recommended tutorials](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/MLatImperial2016/wiki#tutorials). On the first seminar we will introduce them to you but to complete the excercises you will need to study most of them yourself. You can practice your skills by creating test ipython notebook on [everware](https://everware.rep.school.yandex.net/) or [install python on your computer](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/MLatImperial2016/wiki#install-python-on-your-computer).
